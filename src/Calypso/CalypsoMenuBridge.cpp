/*
 * Phase 41 (Calypso): HTML meta-menu bridge — implementation.
 * Whole file is Emscripten-only — the native desktop build never sees it.
 *
 * Pattern (plan §5.1): the JS overlay screens (web/public/screens/*.js) drive
 * the engine through small EMSCRIPTEN_KEEPALIVE C exports defined here. Helpers
 * live inside namespace OpenXcom; exports live in one extern "C" block. This
 * mirrors the structure of CalypsoTutorial.cpp (whole-file guard, namespace
 * helpers, trailing extern "C" exports) and the calypso_menu_* knobs in
 * Engine/EmscriptenHarness.cpp.
 *
 * String/JSON returns build into a function-local `static std::string s_buf`
 * so the returned const char* stays valid until the next call (single-threaded
 * JS↔WASM, no reentrancy). No JSON library in the engine — build strings by
 * hand and escape text through jsonEscape.
 *
 * Slice A0 ships only the liveness probe; later slices append the New Game /
 * New Battle / Load-Save / Mods / Options exports to the same extern "C" block.
